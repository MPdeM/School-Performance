# pandas-challenge
this project uses Python Pandas to analyze district-wide standarized
school test results to showcase trends in school performance.

First the analysis is done at the district level and summarizes: 
    Total Schools
    Total Students
    Total Budget
    Average Math Score
    Average Reading Score
    % Passing Math
    % Passing Reading
    Overall Passing Rate (Average of the above two)
Then the same analysis is done but at the School level. 
Also the 5 lowest school performers are highligthed.

Then math and reading test scores are analyzed by grades (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) 
at each school.
Finally, the test scores are analyzed as a function of spending, 
school size, and typo of school.

Some of the conclusion from this dataset are:

1 High School students attending Charter Schools have higher 
scores in math&reading than those attending District schools. 
2 Data shows thet the bigger the school the higher the % 
pecentage of non passing reading and math.
